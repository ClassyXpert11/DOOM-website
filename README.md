This is a Doom Eternal website that i made whilst i was learning web development. Just made this project for fun and as a way to practice some skills. It has loads of high res images and audios for almost every page. When you download it, it will be a 488mb file (this is because of the images and audios). In order for you to see the website you will need to:<br> 
•Download it<br>
•Extract it<br>
•Open the folder<br>
•Find 'home.html'<br>
•Open 'home.html'
